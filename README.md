# Chaltron-template
Once upon a time [`chaltron`](https://github.com/vicvega/chaltron) was a `rails` engine.

Now `chaltron` is a template including `bootstrap` and `esbuild`, working with `rails8`.

For older rails version consider updating...

Just type 

```
rails new myapp -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vicvega/chaltron-template/master/template.rb -j esbuild -c bootstrap
```

and enjoy! 🍺🍺
